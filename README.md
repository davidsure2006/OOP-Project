# 📚 Library Management System (OOP-Project)

## Project Overview

The **Library Management System** is a robust console application designed and implemented using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in **C++**. The system provides a comprehensive solution for managing library operations, including book inventory, borrower records, thesis tracking, and user access control for both administrative and staff roles.

## ✨ Features

This system streamlines essential library tasks through several key modules:

* **User Access Control:** Implements a restricted login system for **Admin** and **Staff**, ensuring data integrity and allowing restricted access based on credentials.
* **Core Book Management:** Allows staff to efficiently add new books, manage the existing book inventory, and generate detailed reports on availability.
* **Book Categorization Module:** Enables the updating and precise categorization of books by academic department (e.g., CSE, ECE, IT) for quick retrieval and organization.
* **Borrower Management Module:** Handles user registrations, tracks all currently borrowed books, and enforces borrowing limits to ensure fair resource allocation.
* **Thesis Management Module:** Allows for the addition and categorization of research theses by branch, making them easily accessible to faculty and students.
* **Detailed Reporting:** Capable of generating reports on library inventory, user activity, and overdue books.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

Since this is a C++ console application, you will need a C++ compiler (like g++ or Visual Studio) to build and run the executable.

### Prerequisites

* A C++ compiler (e.g., g++ for Linux/macOS/Git Bash, or MinGW on Windows).

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/davidsure2006/OOP-Project.git](https://github.com/davidsure2006/OOP-Project.git)
    cd OOP-Project
    ```

2.  **Compile the Source Code:**
    Assuming your main file is named `main.cpp` and you are using g++:
    ```bash
    g++ -o library_management main.cpp -std=c++11
    ```

3.  **Run the Executable:**
    ```bash
    ./library_management
    ```
    The application will then launch in your terminal, prompting you for login credentials.
